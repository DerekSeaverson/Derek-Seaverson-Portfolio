# Portfolio

This is a portfolio to make it easy to access all my personal projects and any other information that may be of use. 

Please refer [here]() for information and progress on my most recent project that I am working on.

## About this Portfolio

This portfolio consists of some of my personal projects that range from .NET API webpages to personal Video Game projects that I tend to work on in my free time. Some of these projects are from course work in college as well. Some examples of college course work consist of simple Android Studio applications and other projects like simple Video Game projects on platforms such as Unity and GameMaker Studio.
