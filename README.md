# Portfolio

This is a portfolio to make it easy to access all my personal projects and any other information that may be of use. 

Please refer [here]() for information and progress on my most recent project that I am working on.

## About this Portfolio

This portfolio consists of some of my personal projects that range from .NET API webpages to personal Video Game projects that I tend to work on in my free time. Some of these projects are from course work in college as well. Some examples of college course work consist of simple Android Studio applications and other projects like simple Video Game projects on platforms such as Unity and GameMaker Studio. 

## Projects

*This is an in progress list of my current projects as they are uploaded and properly formatted within GitHub.*

* [Space Offensive](#space-offensive)
* [Wardford Keep](#wardford-keep)
* [Maniacal Mages](#maniacal-mages)
* [Android Project(s)](#android-projects)
* [.NET API Website](#net-api-website)


## Project Specifics

### Space Offensive
> Space Offensive is a top-down 2D shooter created using the Godot application using the custom GDScript used within Godot. 

*This project is my most recent project. It is in the beginning stages of programming and at a state in which I haven't uploaded any of the progress to Github yet. Once I have make a substancial jump in progress, I will update this section with the files for the game.*

### Wardford Keep
> Wardford Keep is a side-scrolling 2D fighting game using melee and bow weapons. This project was created within the Unity platform using the C# language in collaboration with Visual Studio. 
The project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/DerekSeaverson/WardfordKeep) and downloaded to preview and play the game for yourself. 

I am more than happy to hear about any issues/bugs/improvements for the game as I intend to return to this class project and expand on it after progressing my current game project in my free time.

### Maniacal Mages
> Maniacal mages is a top-down 2D exploration game in which the player uses potions to try and survive and find the boss of all the mages in the region and exploring the castle. It was created within the GameMaker platform for a class project during college.
*Although this project was a class submission, I intend to expand on the project in the future and would love any feedback/ideas as how I could expand the game to the next level.*
The project can be accessed [here]() and downloaded to preview and play the game for yourself.

### Android Project(s)
> This is a list of my current projects created within Android Studio as part of a class during college. These applications were programmed mostly with Java and touched on some other programming languages. 

*This list will be updated accordingly once I began to upload and format each project that I feel could have some level of importance to my portfolio as we worked on a multitude of Android applications throughout the course of the class.*

### .NET API Website
> My .NET API Website was a beginner website that I created with the function of the user being able to quickly retrieve all the current movies that contain any words/title that the user queries.

*This website was a simple project to learn the .NET functionality. It was originally a project when applying to a position while job searching, but as I love learning more, I have begun to expand on the project and take it to another level.*
> The .NET API can be accessed [here]() and be downloaded to see if in progress.
